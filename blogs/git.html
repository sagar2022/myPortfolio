        <h3>Git and GitHub are two technologies that every developer should learn, 
          irrespective of their field.</h3>

        <!-- about page -->
        <p>
          If you're a beginner developer, you might think that these two terms 
          mean the same thing – but they're different.
        </p>
        <p>
          This tutorial will help you understand what Git and version control 
          are, the basic Git commands you need to know, how you can use its features
           to boost your work efficiency, and how to extend these features using GitHub.
        </p>
        <p>
          This guide is beginner friendly, as the examples will be very easy to 
          understand. It will also be a generalized tutorial so anyone can follow 
          along no matter what your favorite programming language is.
        </p>
        <p>
          For our project, we'll make a to-do list written in a text (txt) file. 
          You will see how we can use the features of Git to work on and create a 
          final version of the list.
        </p>
        <div>
          <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
          <p>
            In order to complete this tutorial, you'll need the following:
          </p>
          <ul class="git-lists">
            <li>A command line interface.</li>
            <li>A text editor of your choice (I will be using VS Code).</li>
            <li>A GitHub account.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="git-que">
          <h2>What is Git?</h2>
          <p>Git is a version control system which lets you track changes you make 
            to your files over time. With Git, you can revert to various states of 
            your files (like a time traveling machine). You can also make a copy of 
            your file, make changes to that copy, and then merge these changes to the 
            original copy.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, you could be working on a website's landing page and discover 
            that you do not like the navigation bar. But at the same time, you might 
            not want to start altering its components because it might get worse.
          </p>
          <p>
            With Git, you can create an identical copy of that file and play around 
            with the navigation bar. Then, when you are satisfied with your changes, 
            you can merge the copy to the original file.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are not limited to using Git just for source code files – you can 
            also use it to keep track of text files or even images. This means 
            that Git is not just for developers – anyone can find it helpful.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="git-install">
          <h3>How to install Git</h3>
          <p>
            In order to use Git, you have to install it on your computer. To do this, 
            you can download the latest version on the <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Official Website</a>. 
            You can download for your operating system from the options given. 
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also install Git using the command line, but since the commands vary with each 
            operating system, we'll focus on the more general approach.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="init">
          <h3>
            How to configure Git
          </h3>
          <p>
            I will assume that at this point you have installed Git. To verify this, you can run this command on the 
            command line: <code> git --version</code>. This shows you the current version installed on you PC.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next thing you'll need to do is to set your username and email address. Git will use this 
            information to identify who made specific changes to files. 
          </p>
          <p>
            To set your username, type and execute these commands: <code> git config --global user.name "YOUR_USERNAME"</code>  and 
            <code> git config --global user.email "YOUR_EMAIL"</code>. Just make sure to replace 
            <code> "YOUR_USERNAME" </code>and <code> "YOUR_EMAIL" </code>with the values you choose.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="git-create">
          <h2>How to Create and Initialize a Project in Git</h2>
          <p>
            We are finally done with installing and setting up Git. It is now time to create our project. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I have created a folder on my desktop called <code>Git and GitHub tutorial</code>. Using the command line, navigate to 
            your new project's location. For me, I would run the following commands:
          </p>
          <p><code>cd desktop</code></p>
          <p><code>cd Git and GitHub tutorial</code></p>
          <p>
            If you are new to the command line and are still learning how to use it to navigate around your PC, 
            then I would suggest using Microsoft's Visual Studio Code. It is a code editor which has an 
            inbuilt terminal for executing commands. You can download 
            it <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">here</a>. 
          </p>
          <p>
            After installing VS Code, open your project in the editor and open a new terminal for your project. 
            This automatically points the terminal/command line to your project's path.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now to initialize your project, simply run <code>git init</code>. This will tell Git to get ready to start watching 
            your files for every change that occurs. It looks like this:
          </p>
          <img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/11/Screenshot--95-.png" alt="git-init">
          <p>
            The first line has information about my PC and the path to where the folder exists. The second line is the command
            <code>git init</code> , and the third line is the response sent back telling me that my repository (repo) has 
             been initialized. It is considered empty because we have not told Git what files to track. 
          </p>
          <p>
            A repository is just another way to define a project being watched/tracked by Git.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="git-project">
          <h3>Git project files</h3>
          <p>
            I have created only one file called <code>todo.txt</code> . This is what the file looks like:
          </p>
          <div class="todo-txt">
            <h4>MY TO-DO LIST</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>Write an article.</li>
              <li>Code.</li>
              <li>Study books.</li>
              <li>Attend classes on time.</li>
              <li>Visit aunt.</li>
              <li>Apply for remote jobs. </li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <p>
            Before we proceed learning with other git command. Lets talk about Github.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="github">
          <h2>What is GitHub?</h2>
          <p>
            GitHub is an online hosting service for Git repositories. Imagine working on a project 
            at home and while you are away, maybe at a friend's place, you suddenly remember 
            the solution to a code error that has kept you restless for days.
          </p>
          <p>
            You cannot make these changes because your PC is not with you. But if you have your project 
            hosted on GitHub, you can access and download that project with a command on whatever computer 
            you have access to. Then you can make your changes and push the latest version back to GitHub.
          </p>
          <p>
            In summary, GitHub lets you store your repo on their platform. Another awesome feature that 
            comes with GitHub is the ability to collaborate with other developers from any location.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now that we have created and initialized our project locally, let's push it to GitHub.
          </p>
          <p>
            f you are a beginner, you will come across some new terms like push, commit, add, and so 
            on – but do not be overwhelmed by them. With some practice you will be able to remember 
            these terms and what they do.
